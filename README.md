# Pipelined_MIPS_CPU

## This project is an implementation of MIPS pipelined CPU with 10 arithmetic instructions and 4 branch instructions which supports hazard detection and data forwarding. 
## The 10 arithmetic instructions are as follows:
1. ADD
2. ADDI
3. SUB
4. AND
5. OR
6. SLT
7. SLTI
8. LW
9. SW
10. MUTI

## The 4 branch instructions are as follows:
1. BEQ
2. BNE
3. BGE
4. BGT
